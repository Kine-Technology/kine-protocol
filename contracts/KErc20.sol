/**
* Original work from Compound: https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/CErc20.sol
* Modified to work in the Kine system.
* Main modifications:
*   1. removed Comp token related logics.
*   2. removed interest rate model related logics.
*   3. removed borrow logics, user can only borrow Kine MCD (see KMCD).
*   4. removed error code propagation mechanism, using revert to fail fast and loudly.
